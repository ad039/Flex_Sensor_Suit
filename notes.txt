physics informed neural network
 - test if your system is "physical"
 - what models could I have for human movement?
 - shoulder to elbow and elbow to hand are constant

feed the previous prediction as input using a loop
e.g.
for i in range(num_samples):
	test_x = [sensor_data[i], prev_output]
	output = model(test_x)
